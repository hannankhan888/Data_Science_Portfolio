# Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project:

# Analysis Of Bike-Share Customers

The goal of this study was to showcase the skills acquired during the
Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, including *R*.  
The business task includes analyzing data from a bike-sharing company.
Specifically, the company would like to convert its casual members
(single ride/full-day pass) into annual members (yearly subscription).
The **GOAL OF THIS REPORT** is to investigate how casual members use
bikes compared to annual members.  
The final report can be found as a html document in the [Final Report Folder](https://github.com/hannankhan888/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Bike_Share_Analysis_Case_Study/Final_Report).
