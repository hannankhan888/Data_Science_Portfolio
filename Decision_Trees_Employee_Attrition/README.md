# Using Decision Trees To Predict Employee Attrition
The goals of this project were:

* Conduct EDA on the employee attrition [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset).
* Find the best possible tree model, or ensemble method to predict employee attrition.
* Tune the best model.
* Deploy the model to a web app such that it can be accessed by anyone.
	* Web app available [here](https://share.streamlit.io/hannankhan888/employee_attrition_webapp/main).
